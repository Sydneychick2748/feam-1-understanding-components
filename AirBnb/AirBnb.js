/**
 Using the image of the Airbnb UI, answer the following questions:
 1. What are four main components you see on the page?
nav bar 
search bar 
filters 
cards 



 2. Put the components in order to show the parent/child relationship. So if component x is the mother of y and grandmother of z, you would write: 
    1. x - search bar 
    2. y - filter 
    3. z - cards




3. Which component needs access to every piece of data? Which component only needs access to the filtered data?

 
search bar will need all the data and the cards will only need the filtered data 




4. What are three different key/value pairs that will be needed for each listing?

location 
views 
date 
price 







5. What JavaScript could we write to filter the objects based on whether or not the listing has a pool?
 */
// Assuming you have an array of listing objects
// Filter listings that have a pool
// Filter listings that do not have a pool
